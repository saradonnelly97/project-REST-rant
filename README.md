# Project REST-Rant

REST-Rant is an app where users can review restaurants.

## Key Features: 

**Rant and Rave:** Tell the world how you REALLY feel about your least favorite (or favorite) place to eat. Rate your dining experience on a scale of 1 dumpster fire to 5 (or maybe more). 

**Capture it:** Post photos of your meals; are they Rave-worthy? 

**You Just Need to Talk it Out:** Have an open conversation with your friends and family in the messenger. Hate tomatoes? Guess we won't be getting pizza tonight!
